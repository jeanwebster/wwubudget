                  <p>Tuition is the amount that Western charges students for instruction and the amount of revenue depends on enrollments. 
                    However, only a portion of the tuition revenue collected can be used to support university operations. By law, tuition includes an operating fee and a building fee. 
                    The building fee revenue can only be used for building projects and maintenance.</p>

             <p>The Administrative Services Assessment (ASA) is a fee charged to self-supporting departments to partially recapture overhead costs for providing general administrative support that is funded by state operating revenue. ASA fee revenue is transferred into the universityâ€™s institutional budget and used to support internal funding requests and contingency needs.</p>

Earned income from university investments is also included in this amount.</p>

                        move the expense to the July fiscal year. Deferrals occur when the exchange of cash precedes the delivery of goods and services (prepaid expense &
